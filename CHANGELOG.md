## v0.2.8 (2025-10-17)

- **Background Daemon Architecture**: Implemented separate daemon mode for macOS/Windows to solve TUI tracking interference issue
  - Created `neura_hustle_daemon` binary that runs silently in background tracking all apps
  - Created `neura_hustle_tracker` TUI binary for viewing stats (can open/close without affecting tracking)
  - Solves fundamental issue: TUI can't track other apps when IT is the focused window
  - Daemon polls active window every 100ms (same as unified mode for real-time accuracy)
  - Daemon auto-saves sessions hourly + on app switch + graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
- **Platform-Specific Modes**:
  - **Linux X11**: Unified mode works perfectly - TUI + tracking in one process (no changes, no additional requirements)
  - **Linux Wayland**: Unified mode works perfectly - **REQUIRES** [Window Calls GNOME extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4724/window-calls/) for window tracking
  - **macOS/Windows**: Daemon mode recommended - background tracking + separate TUI viewer
  - Both modes available on all platforms - user chooses at runtime which binary to run
- **New Makefile Commands**:
  - `make daemon-start` - Start background tracking daemon (starts DB, builds daemon, runs in background)
  - `make daemon-stop` - Stop background tracking daemon
  - `make daemon-status` - Check if daemon is running (shows PID and log location)
  - `make view` - Open TUI to view stats (warns if daemon not running)
  - `make build-daemon` - Build only the daemon binary
  - Updated `make build` to build only TUI binary (for faster incremental builds)
  - Updated `make help` with clear Linux vs macOS/Windows command guidance
- **One-Liner Installation Updates**:
  - **Linux**: Creates `hustle` alias (unified mode - works perfectly)
  - **macOS**: Creates `hustle-start`, `hustle-stop`, `hustle-view`, `hustle-status` aliases (daemon mode)
  - **Windows**: Creates `hustle-start`, `hustle-stop`, `hustle-view`, `hustle-status` functions (daemon mode)
  - Removed comments from .env generation in one-liners (comments broke execution)
- **README Enhancements**:
  - Added "Which Mode Should I Use?" decision guide section
  - Clear explanation of why Linux uses unified mode (works perfectly) vs macOS/Windows daemon mode (TUI interference)
  - Updated Platform-Specific Notes with daemon mode instructions for macOS/Windows
  - Added Wayland extension requirement documentation for Linux users
  - Clarified that Linux tracking is 100% accurate in unified mode
  - Updated daemon mode documentation with clear start/stop/view workflow
- **Code Organization**:
  - Added `src/active_window/daemon.rs` - Background tracking daemon (268 lines)
  - Added `src/utils/daemon_main.rs` - Daemon entry point with logging setup
  - Added `src/active_window/mod.rs` - Module declaration
  - Updated `Cargo.toml` to build two separate binaries
  - Added `daemon.log` and `daemon.pid` to .gitignore
  - Daemon writes to `daemon.log` when DEBUG_LOGS_ENABLED=true (separate from TUI's app.log)

  - macOS Terminal.app no longer incorrectly renamed to "gnome-terminal"
  - Wayland dot/underscore splitting (e.g., "org.gnome.Nautilus") only applied on Linux
  - Linux-specific apps (nautilus, gedit, rhythmbox, etc.) only detected on Linux
  - Cross-platform apps (Chrome, Firefox, VS Code, Slack, etc.) still work on all platforms
- **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Comprehensive platform-specific logging for troubleshooting
  - Shows raw window data: app_name, title, process_path, position
  - Logs original vs normalized app names to see transformation
  - Platform-specific debug output with OS-specific details
  - Error messages now show relevant environment variables per platform
- **Optional Debug Logging**: Add `DEBUG_LOGS_ENABLED=true` to .env to enable detailed logging

  - Debug mode writes comprehensive logs to app.log
  - Debug logs include platform detection, window detection, and app name normalization
  - Disabled by default to avoid unnecessary file generation

  - Windows errors show USERPROFILE, COMPUTERNAME
  - Linux errors properly handle Wayland vs X11 detection
  - All error messages point users to enable DEBUG_LOGS_ENABLED for troubleshooting

## v0.2.6 (2025-10-16)

- **Migration Note for v0.2.5 Database Rename**: Database name was changed from 'time_tracker' to 'hustle-tracker' in v0.2.5
  - **For existing users who want to keep old database name**: Update your `compose.yml` POSTGRES_DB and `.env` DATABASE_URL to use your current database name (e.g., `time_tracker`)
  - **For existing users who want to rename to hustle-tracker**:
    1. Stop the database: `docker compose down`
    2. Start database: `docker compose up -d`
    3. Connect and rename: `docker exec -it neura-hustle-tracker-postgres-1 psql -U <your_username> -c "ALTER DATABASE time_tracker RENAME TO \"hustle-tracker\";"`
    4. Update `.env` DATABASE_URL to use `/hustle-tracker` instead of `/time_tracker`
    5. Restart app with `cargo run` or `make run`
- **Global Command Alias**: One-liner installers now create a global `hustle` command that works from any directory
  - Linux: Adds alias to `~/.bashrc` and sources it automatically
  - macOS: Adds alias to `~/.zshrc` and sources it automatically
  - Windows: Adds PowerShell function to `$PROFILE` and loads it automatically
  - After installation, simply type `hustle` from anywhere to start the app
- **Fixed TUI Corruption Bug**: Logs now write to `app.log` file instead of stderr, preventing log messages from corrupting the terminal UI
- **Logging Improvements**: Changed default log level from debug to info for cleaner logs, reduced zbus verbosity
- **Better UX**: `cargo run` now works cleanly without requiring stderr redirection (`2> debug.log`)
