# NO SETUP REQUIRED! ðŸŽ‰
# If this file is missing or values are empty, the app will automatically
# generate secure credentials for you on first run.
#
# For most users: Just delete this file (or leave it as-is) and run the app.
# The app will create a .env file with auto-generated credentials.
#
# ========================================
# Advanced: Manual Configuration
# ========================================
# If you want to use specific credentials (e.g., for an existing database),
# copy this file to .env and fill in your values:

POSTGRES_USERNAME=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=

# Full database URL (matches the format: postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/time_tracker)
DATABASE_URL=

# ========================================
# Notes:
# ========================================
# - Auto-generated credentials are cryptographically secure
# - You can find generated credentials in the .env file after first run
# - If you modify credentials, make sure all three values match
# - The database name is always 'time_tracker'
# - Default PostgreSQL port is 5432
